However, recently Google started charging for their API: http://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/, so we will use the Geocoder Python package instead: https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/index.html.\n",

So, in order to make sure that you get the coordinates for all of our neighborhoods, you can run a while loop for each postal code.
